Simple
================
A clone of [Obtvse](http://github.com/NateW/obtvse).

About
============
The point of Simple is to be simple. The blog is 1 file (excluding resources) with a few simple pure-python dependancies, it doesn't
require a database server, has a small footprint and is fairly fast.

Installation
============
Its quite simple. Go download Python 2.7+, Flask, Sqlalchemy and flask-sqlalchemy and you are good to go.
To create a settings file run create_config.py and enter some details, then run simple.py.

Example
============
You can see my blog running this software [here](http://tomforb.es).
